// Pure decision logic for the shared usage cache + single-flight refresh lock.
//
// This module has NO I/O — no Convex, no fetch, no node APIs — so it is unit-testable in
// isolation (see usage-cache-core.test.ts) and safe to import from anywhere. The Convex
// mutation in convex/usageCache.ts mirrors `claimDecision` by hand (Convex modules and the
// Next app don't share a module graph), so the tested rule and the transactional lock agree.
//
// Why this exists: Anthropic refresh tokens are single-use and rotate on every refresh. The
// dashboard (per-minute) and the Convex cron (5-minute) both poll the same account, so without
// coordination they RACE the single-use token — the loser sends the now-dead token and Anthropic
// answers 429 rate_limit_error (an obfuscated auth rejection with no Retry-After that sticks for
// 30+ minutes under a retry-storm). The cache TTL coalesces reads; the CAS lock guarantees only
// one holder ever refreshes the token at a time.

export const CACHE_TTL_MS = 300_000; // 5 min — within this, reads are served from cache (no upstream).
export const REFRESH_LOCK_MS = 120_000; // 2 min lease, renewed by the active holder during slower upstream calls.
export const COOLDOWN_MS = 15 * 60_000; // 15 min — back off upstream after a hard rejection (dead token / 429).
export const TOKEN_SKEW_MS = 60_000; // refresh the access token only when it expires within 60 s.

//   fetch    → go to upstream (the caller then contends for the single-flight lock).
// Fresh is checked first so a just-refreshed account is never mislabeled stale by a lingering
// cooldown; in practice the two are mutually exclusive (a failure that sets cooldown never
